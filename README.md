# Payment Method Tracker
This browser-based program keeps a database of accounts and payment methods. The intended use case is for easily referencing what payment method is used for what account. This application does not connect to any third-party websites or services. It is for information tracking only.

An example use case: a credit card has expired or had to be replaced. The user can search for accounts using that payment method to get a list of all accounts needing to be updated with new payment information.  

Currently, this project is meant for personal use and is serving as a demonstration of my coding.
